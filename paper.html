<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>The <em>SamsaRaLight</em> R package (Figure 1) provides a simplified and efficient R interface to the SamsaraLight ray-tracing model [@courbaud_simulating_2003], enabling explicit simulation of light competition in forest stands. It allows users to estimate the energy absorbed by individual trees, the light transmitted to the forest floor, or the radiation reaching user-defined locations via virtual sensors. Forest stands are represented in 3D, with individual crowns modelled using symmetric or asymmetric geometric shapes and stand attributes including size, slope, and aspect. Direct and diffuse radiation is discretised according to location and cast through the canopy, allowing light attenuation across successive crowns to be explicitly simulated. Outputs include light interception, transmission, and competition variables at tree, ground, or sensor levels, supporting studies of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration dynamics within reproducible and optimised R workflows.</p>

<h3 id="light-competition-and-the-need-for-ray-tracing-approaches">Light competition and the need for ray-tracing approaches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#light-competition-and-the-need-for-ray-tracing-approaches"></a></h3>
<p>Light is a key resource driving the dynamics of saplings and trees [@binkley_light_2013], inducing strong plasticity in crown dimensions under competitive pressure [@touzot_shade_2025]. Numerous forest radiative transfer models have therefore been developed to represent canopy structure and light absorption processes [@ligot_forest_2014]. A defining feature of light competition is its strong asymmetry, resulting from the attenuation of light along its path through successive canopy layers [@weiner_asymmetric_1990; @schwinning_mechanisms_1998]. Accurately representing this process requires ray-tracing approaches that explicitly account for light path length across overlapping tree crowns.</p>
<p>The SamsaraLight ray-tracing model, developed by Courbaud et al. [-@courbaud_simulating_2003], is one of the most widely used models for this purpose in forest ecology. It has been applied to study the effects of light interception on tree growth and mortality dynamics [@beauchamp_light_2025], as well as to quantify light transmittance to the forest floor and its influence on regeneration processes [@ligot_managing_2014; @ligot_tree_2016].</p>

<h3 id="integration-within-forest-simulators-and-limits-of-existing-implementations">Integration within forest simulators and limits of existing implementations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#integration-within-forest-simulators-and-limits-of-existing-implementations"></a></h3>
<p>Explicitly coupling light competition with forest simulators is essential to analyse how silvicultural strategies influence stand structure, dynamics, and regeneration [@lafond_uneven-aged_2014]. For this reason, SamsaraLight has been integrated as a core module in numerous forest simulators developed within the CAPSIS platform [@dufour-kowalski_capsis_2012], including Samsara2 [@courbaud_applying_2015], PDG-ARENA [@rouet_pdg-arena_2025], HETEROFOR 1.0 [@jonard_heterofor_2020; @de_wergifosse_heterofor_2020], and RReShar [@barrere_oak_2024].</p>
<p>However, the tight coupling of SamsaraLight to CAPSIS, a Java-based framework, limits its independent use and integration into common statistical workflows. To address this, Fortin [-@fortin_executing_2020] introduced the R packages J4R and RCapsis, enabling CAPSIS models to be accessed from R. Despite this advance, the approach remains technically demanding, requiring interaction with external software, intermediate files, and multi-language pipelines, which restricts its accessibility for many users.</p>

<h3 id="simplifying-and-broadening-access-through-an-r-implementation">Simplifying and broadening access through an R implementation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#simplifying-and-broadening-access-through-an-r-implementation"></a></h3>
<p>Many researchers addressing forest dynamics and regeneration questions increasingly rely on R for model fitting, simulation analysis, and reproducible workflows, often outside the CAPSIS ecosystem. While some forest models have been fully reimplemented in R (e.g. SurEau-Ecos [@ruffault_sureau-ecos_2022]), ray-tracing approaches remain computationally intensive and difficult to integrate without complex software dependencies. A native R implementation of SamsaraLight simplifies the explicit representation of light interception and transmission, enabling its direct use in studies of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration.</p>
<p>Beyond simplifying existing workflows, the SamsaRaLight R package facilitates links with emerging technologies and research fields. In particular, the increasing availability of LiDAR data in forest ecology [@lines_shape_2022] creates opportunities to couple ray-tracing light models with LiDAR-based crown reconstruction tools such as ITSMe [@terryn_analysing_2023] and LidaRtRee [@monnet_lidartree_2025]. More broadly, providing an accessible R implementation may foster applications beyond forestry, including agroforestry, where tree shading strongly influences crop production [@dupraz_hi-safe_2019].</p>

<p>The <em>SamsaRaLight</em> R package provides a fully native R implementation of the SamsaraLight ray-tracing model. Forest stands and radiation inputs are defined using standard R formats, with dedicated functions to check and construct virtual stands from tree inventories and to derive monthly radiation data based on stand location. Monthly global radiation and diffuse-to-global ratios are retrieved from the European PVGIS database [@huld_new_2012]. Simulations are executed with default settings suitable for most applications, while allowing advanced users to adjust ray-tracing parameters and internal model behaviour. Standard R methods for S3 objects (<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html" class="external-link">print()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html" class="external-link">summary()</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html" class="external-link">plot()</a></code>) enable inspection and visualisation of both input stands and output light variables, with graphical outputs generated using <em>ggplot2</em> [@wickham_ggplot2_2016].</p>

<p>To ensure efficient computation, the core of the SamsaraLight model is implemented in C++ and interfaced with R using <em>Rcpp</em> [@eddelbuettel_rcpp_2025]. This design leverages the computational performance and memory management of C++ while preserving the flexibility of R-based workflows. Ray-tracing calculations can be executed in parallel using shared-memory parallelisation with OpenMP, with fine control over the number of cores and the ability to activate or deactivate parallel execution depending on computational constraints.</p>
