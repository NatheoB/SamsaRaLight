	abstract = {Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees with crops and/or livestock, can lead to multiple economic and ecological benefits compared to trees and crops/livestock grown separately. Field experimentation has been the primary approach to understanding the tree–crop interactions inherent in agroforestry. However, the number of field experiments has been limited by slow tree maturation and difficulty in obtaining consistent funding. Models have the potential to overcome these hurdles and rapidly advance understanding of agroforestry systems. Hi-sAFe is a mechanistic, biophysical model designed to explore the interactions within agroforestry systems that mix trees with crops. The model couples the pre-existing STICS crop model to a new tree model that includes several plasticity mechanisms responsive to tree–tree and tree–crop competition for light, water, and nitrogen. Monoculture crop and tree systems can also be simulated, enabling calculation of the land equivalent ratio. The model’s 3D and spatially explicit form is key for accurately representing many competition and facilitation processes. Hi-sAFe is a novel tool for exploring agroforestry designs (e.g., tree spacing, crop type, tree row orientation), management strategies (e.g., thinning, branch pruning, root pruning, fertilization, irrigation), and responses to environmental variation (e.g., latitude, climate change, soil depth, soil structure and fertility, fluctuating water table). By improving our understanding of the complex interactions within agroforestry systems, Hi-sAFe can ultimately facilitate adoption of agroforestry as a sustainable land-use practice.},

It has been suggested that trees of different species and sizes occupy complementary positions in space, which would act as a mechanism to increase canopy light interception and wood production. However, greater canopy light interception reduces the average amount and variability of transmitted radiation, offering fewer opportunities for all species to regenerate and to maintain forest heterogeneity in the long run. We investigated whether increasing overstory heterogeneity indeed results in greater canopy light interception and lower variability in transmittance. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of forest stands with three typical forest structures, 10 mixtures of four tree species, and three different basal areas. We used the forest light interception model SamsaraLight and performed three-way analyses of covariance to analyze the effects of the three varied components of forest heterogeneity. We found no evidence that increasing structural heterogeneity increases canopy light interception. However, the light interception by mixed canopies was greater than the weighted average of light interception by the corresponding pure canopies. Variability in transmittance increased in some cases with compositional heterogeneity and, to a lesser extent, with tree size inequalities. The advantage of heterogeneous forests is in opportunities for natural regeneration, as well as in opportunities to enhance canopy light interception.},

An alternative approach consists of running a local server in Java and linking it to an R environment through a socket connection. This alternative approach has been implemented in an R package called J4R. This article shows how this approach makes it possible to simplify the calls to Java methods and to integrate the R vectorization. The downside is a loss of performance.

Calibration and evaluation of a forest radiative transfer module coupled to a spatially explicit tree growth model were repeated for different configuration options (i.e., turbid medium vs porous envelope to calculate light interception by trees, crown shapes of contrasting complexity to account for their asymmetry) and response variables used for fitting (transmitted radiation and/or tree growth data). The turbid medium outperformed the porous envelope approach. The more complex crown shapes enabling to account for crown asymmetry improved performances when including growth data in the calibration.

	abstract = {A widespread increase in tree mortality has been observed around the globe, and this trend is likely to continue because of ongoing climate-induced increases in drought frequency and intensity. This raises the need to identify regions and ecosystems that are likely to experience the most frequent and significant damage. We present SurEau-Ecos, a trait-based, plant hydraulic model designed to predict tree desiccation and mortality at scales from stand to region. SurEau-Ecos draws on the general principles of the SurEau model but introduces a simplified representation of plant architecture and alternative numerical schemes. Both additions were made to facilitate model parameterization and large-scale applications. In SurEau-Ecos, the water fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere are represented through two plant organs (a leaf and a stem, which includes the volume of the trunk, roots and branches) as the product of an interface conductance and the difference between water potentials. Each organ is described by its symplasmic and apoplasmic compartments. The dynamics of a plant's water status beyond the point of stomatal closure are explicitly represented via residual transpiration flow, plant cavitation and solicitation of plants' water reservoirs. In addition to the “explicit” numerical scheme of SurEau, we implemented a “semi-implicit” and “implicit” scheme. Both schemes led to a substantial gain in computing time compared to the explicit scheme (\&gt;10 000 times), and the implicit scheme was the most accurate. We also observed similar plant water dynamics between SurEau-Ecos and SurEau but slight disparities in infra-daily variations of plant water potentials, which we attributed to the differences in the representation of plant architecture between models. A global model's sensitivity analysis revealed that factors controlling plant desiccation rates differ depending on whether leaf water potential is below or above the point of stomatal closure. Total available water for the plant, leaf area index and the leaf water potential at 50 \% stomatal closure mostly drove the time needed to reach stomatal closure. Once stomata are closed, resistance to cavitation, residual cuticular transpiration and plant water stocks mostly determined the time to hydraulic failure. Finally, we illustrated the potential of SurEau-Ecos to simulate regional drought-induced mortality over France. SurEau-Ecos is a promising tool to perform regional-scale predictions of drought-induced hydraulic failure, determine the most vulnerable areas and ecosystems to drying conditions, and assess the dynamics of forest flammability.},

	abstract = {How ecologists think about above-ground forest structure and dynamics is fundamentally shaped by the data we can collect. This has historically been limited to what is possible with simple equipment such as a tape measure, which has often led to the three-dimensional complexity of the form of trees being reduced to the diameter of a trunk, and perhaps the height of the tree. While simple and pragmatic, this trunk-centric framework has some obvious limitations, as many of the major processes that influence how trees grow and interact with one another happen up in the canopy. For instance, the structural complexity of individual trees' leaf and branch arrangements and how trees fill canopy space are direct drivers of individual tree and whole-forest productivity and dynamics, but remain poorly studied because they have traditionally been challenging to measure. However, recent advances in remote sensing and data processing are revolutionising our ability to accurately measure tree and forest structure from leaves to landscapes. Not only do we have access to more accurate data on structure, but we also have data spanning a much broader range of spatial, temporal and ecological scales, and new avenues of research that challenge how we understand forests are emerging. Synthesis. Here, we review the new opportunities these technologies bring us to measure the physical structure of trees and highlight the technological developments needed to maximise their value to the field of forest ecology. Today, perhaps for the first time, how ecologists choose to study above-ground forest structure and dynamics is limited more by creativity than by what we can measure.},

	abstract = {The constraint caused by wild ungulates on forest regeneration is increasing worldwide. Hypotheses for plant association effects predict that species susceptible to herbivory can gain protection from other neighbouring plant species. In theory, such interactions could help limit the impact of browsing on the regeneration of specific tree species. However, the presence of neighbouring species can also result in increasing competition for resources between species. The resultant effects on forest regeneration of these interactions, both positive (protection against herbivores) and negative (inter-specific competition) are still unclear. To gain insight, we coupled models of browsing by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and of forest dynamics to simulate trajectories of oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) regeneration admixed with species of contrasted palatability and growth rate under different scenarios of browsing pressure and initial sapling density. We also investigated how releasing oak saplings from all or specific neighbours during the simulation affect regeneration. We found that admixed species composition had a relatively weak effect on the density of oak recruits, but a strong effect on the duration of the regeneration phase. Oak regenerated faster when admixed with species of intermediate growth and low palatability (Fagus sylvatica) than with species of fast growth and high palatability (Carpinus betulus L.), except at intermediate sapling density and high browsing pressure where we found the opposite. Releasing oak from all competitors was most effective in promoting oak regeneration when admixed with both species together, although the benefit of competition release was much weaker at high browsing pressure. Lastly, we found that at low initial sapling density (i.e., 10 saplings/m2), oak regeneration was driven only by browsing and the effect of admixing species became negligible. Our study showed that admixing oak with palatable neighbours impedes rather than improves oak regeneration due to increased competition for resources. As such, we suggest that the benefits of herbivore diversion can be off-set by increased inter-specific competition.},

	abstract = {Simulating the dynamics of heterogeneous forests calls for spatially explicit radiation transmission models at the scale of individual trees and requiring only a short computing time. Such a model was developed for spatially heterogeneous coniferous forest canopies. Based on the interception of light rays by parabolic crowns, it simultaneously calculates the radiation intercepted by each tree and the distribution of irradiance on the ground. For every sky direction, parallel rays aim at ground cell centres and are intercepted by tree crowns on their way. Slope and exposure are taken into account eliminating rays coming from above the slope. Optimisation in computing time is obtained by pre-selecting for each ray direction a rectangular cell neighbourhood around the target cell in such a way that potentially intercepting trees can only be found in this neighbourhood. Model evaluation was done by comparing hemispherical photographs with model predictions in a spatially heterogeneous Norway spruce (Picea abies, L. Karst) stand at the upper montane level in the Alps. Thanks to a satisfactory fit between model and data and a reasonably short computing time (about 2min for 0.25ha), the model can be considered for integration into a forest dynamics simulator. In the reference stand, 42\% of incident radiation was intercepted by the highest trees (132ha−1). Due to the clumped structure, 23\% of incident radiation reached the soil. Interception by individual trees varied considerably as a function of tree size and location (from 0 to 60\% of the potential interception of a tree growing in isolation). Irradiance at ground level was also extremely variable (between 0 and 50\% of irradiance above the canopy), illustrating the need for spatial models in heterogeneous stands. The interception of radiation by trees was not affected by slope and exposure, unlike irradiance at ground level, which increased for southern exposures. Therefore, in terms of dynamics, regeneration should be the most sensitive to changes in these factors. Because the model produces precise radiation values at the ecosystem level, it allows analysis of the links between the structure of a forest stand and its energetic functioning synthetically.},

	abstract = {Competition between individuals is a key process that drives tree growth and survival in forests. Ecological theories predict that the effect of competition should be weaker in stressful environments. However, quantitative studies have failed to reach a consensus on the direction of the interaction between climate and competition. In this study, we demonstrate that this interaction appears clearly when we explicitly focus on light competition. We analysed the effect of light competition on tree growth and survival along both temperature and aridity gradients for the 33 major European tree species. We collected forest inventories from nine European countries, encompassing over 1 million trees from Spain to Scandinavia. We used species-specific crown allometric equations to connect this extensive database to the SamsaraLight ray tracing model and to calculate a tree-based light competition index from the light intercepted by the tree crown. Within a given species' climatic niche, the effect of light competition on tree growth and survival decreased towards both the dry and cold margins, supporting the stress gradient hypothesis. Climate mainly affected tree growth in light, with slower growth in drier or colder conditions. In contrast, for survival, climate mainly affected trees in shade, with better survival in the dry or cold stress margins. Among species, the mean sensitivity of tree growth and survival to light competition decreased with increasing mean aridity niche and shade tolerance of the species. Synthesis. Our study emphasises the importance of considering species-specific interactions between light competition and climate on tree growth and survival. The impact of climate change on an individual tree is likely to depend on its light competition status within the forest stand, as well as its species-specific climatic niche and shade tolerance.},

At the same time, the sophistication of techniques for model development and analysis has given rise to a relative compartmentalization of model building and evaluation tasks. Several guidelines invite ecological modelers to follow an organized sequence of development and analysis steps and have coined the term “evaludation” for this process. The objective of this paper is to assess the feasibility and the value of a structured evaludation process, based on the working example of the Samsara2 model, a spatially explicit individual-based forest dynamics model. We implemented the six steps of model design, process level calibration, qualitative evaluation, quantitative evaluation, global sensitivity analysis, and partial recalibration using approximate Bayesian computing. We then evaluated how the evaludation process revealed model strengths and weaknesses, specified the model's conditions of use, clarified how the model works, and provided insights into forest ecosystem functioning. Finally, the efficiency/cost ratio of the process and future improvements are discussed.},

	abstract = {Climate change affects forest growth in numerous and sometimes opposite ways, and the resulting trend is often difficult to predict for a given site. Integrating and structuring the knowledge gained from the monitoring and experimental studies into process-based models is an interesting approach to predict the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. While the first generation of models operates at stand level, one now needs spatially explicit individual-based approaches in order to account for individual variability, local environment modification and tree adaptive behaviour in mixed and uneven-aged forests that are supposed to be more resilient under stressful conditions. The local environment of a tree is strongly influenced by the neighbouring trees, which modify the resource level through positive and negative interactions with the target tree. Among other things, drought stress and vegetation period length vary with tree size and crown position within the canopy.

 In this paper, we describe the phenology and water balance modules integrated in the tree growth model HETEROFOR (HETEROgenous FORest) and evaluate them on six heterogeneous sessile oak and European beech stands with different levels of mixing and development stages and installed on various soil types. More precisely, we assess the ability of the model to reproduce key phenological processes (budburst, leaf development, yellowing and fall) as well as water fluxes.

 Two two-phase models differing regarding their response function to temperature during the chilling period (optimum and sigmoid functions) and a simplified one-phase model are used to predict budburst date. The two-phase model with the optimum function is the least biased (overestimation of 2.46\&thinsp;d), while the one-phase model best accounts for the interannual variability (Pearson's r=0.68). For the leaf development, yellowing and fall, predictions and observations are in accordance. Regarding the water balance module, the predicted throughfall is also in close agreement with the measurements (Pearson's r=0.856; bias\&thinsp;=-1.3\&thinsp;\%), and the soil water dynamics across the year are well reproduced for all the study sites (Pearson's r was between 0.893 and 0.950, and bias was between −1.81 and −9.33\&thinsp;\%). The model also reproduced well the individual transpiration for sessile oak and European beech, with similar performances at the tree and stand scale (Pearson's r of 0.84–0.85 for sessile oak and 0.88–0.89 for European beech). The good results of the model assessment will allow us to use it reliably in projection studies to evaluate the impact of climate change on tree growth in structurally complex stands and test various management strategies to improve forest resilience.},

	abstract = {Given the multiple abiotic and biotic stressors resulting from global changes, management systems and practices must be adapted in order to maintain and reinforce the resilience of forests. Among others, the transformation of monocultures into uneven-aged and mixed stands is an avenue to improve forest resilience. To explore the forest response to these new silvicultural practices under a changing environment, one needs models combining a process-based approach with a detailed spatial representation, which is quite rare.

 We therefore decided to develop our own model (HETEROFOR for HETEROgeneous FORest) according to a spatially explicit approach, describing individual tree growth based on resource sharing (light, water and nutrients). HETEROFOR was progressively elaborated within Capsis (Computer-Aided Projection for Strategies in Silviculture), a collaborative modelling platform devoted to tree growth and stand dynamics.

 This paper describes the carbon-related processes of HETEROFOR (photosynthesis, respiration, carbon allocation and tree dimensional growth) and evaluates the model performances for three broadleaved stands with different species compositions (Wallonia, Belgium). This first evaluation showed that HETEROFOR predicts well individual radial growth (Pearson's correlation of 0.83 and 0.63 for the European beech and sessile oak, respectively) and is able to reproduce size–growth relationships. We also noticed that the net to gross primary production (npp to gpp) ratio option for describing maintenance respiration provides better results than the temperature-dependent routine, while the process-based (Farquhar model) and empirical (radiation use efficiency) approaches perform similarly for photosynthesis. To illustrate how the model can be used to predict climate change impacts on forest ecosystems, we simulated the growth dynamics of the mixed stand driven by three IPCC climate scenarios. According to these simulations, the tree growth trends will be governed by the CO2 fertilization effect, with the increase in vegetation period length and the increase in water stress also playing a role but offsetting each other.},

In uneven aged stand management, understory light can be manipulated by modifying stand structure and composition, in addition to stand density. Using a forest radiative transfer model, we analyzed how different cutting strategies could modify light availability under the post-harvest canopy. To calibrate the model, we measured and mapped trees in 27 plots with structures ranging from secondary-successional oak forests to late-successional beech forests. We measured understory light and crown openness and verified that our forest radiative transfer model well captured the variability of understory light among the studied stands (R2=87\%). We then compared cutting strategies varying in type and intensity and provided indications to promote the regeneration of mixtures of species of different shade tolerances. In particular, creating gaps of about 500m2 provided adequate light for small regeneration clumps. Cutting from below, species-specific cutting and uniform cutting were also appropriate for tree regeneration but uniform cutting required higher harvest intensity. Cutting from above slightly increased understory light and promoted more shade tolerant species.},

We review what is known about the mechanisms that give rise to and modify the degree of size asymmetry in competition among plants, and attempt to clarify some of the confusion in the literature on size asymmetry. We broadly distinguish between mechanisms determined primarily by characteristics of contested resource from those that are influenced by the growth and behavior of the plants themselves. To generate size asymmetric resource competition, a resource must be “pre-emptable.” Because of its directionality, light is the primary, but perhaps not the only, example of a pre-emptable resource. The available data suggest that competition for mineral nutrients is often size symmetric (i.e., contested resources are divided in proportion to competitor sizes), but the potential role of patchily and/or episodically supplied nutrients in causing size asymmetry is largely unexplored. Virtually nothing is known about the size symmetry of competition for water. Plasticity in morphology and physiology acts to reduce the degree of size asymmetry in competition. We argue that an allometric perspective on growth, allocation, resource uptake, and resource utilization can help us understand and quantify the mechanisms through which plants compete.},

	abstract = {The production of stem wood by trees and stands depends on the absorption of light, and the efficiency of converting light into stem wood. Larger trees within a stand tend to absorb more light and use it more efficiently in growing wood; greater growth of large trees typically results from a combination of increased light absorption (about three-fourths of the effect) and increased efficiency of light use (about one-fourth of the effect). Similarly, more productive forests commonly show greater light absorption and higher efficiency of light use; differences of 50–80\% are commonly reported for both light absorption and for light use efficiency in comparisons of forests that differ in species composition, site fertility, and silvicultural treatments. These quantitative assessments of production ecology require estimation of light absorption at the appropriate scale, because patterns of light absorption in relation to leaf area differ fundamentally for trees and stands. Three types of relationships between light absorption and leaf area are important, and the typical patterns differ among types. The absorption of light through the crown of an individual tree (Type I) typically follows a logarithmic trend where each successive layer of leaves absorbs a consistent proportion of incident light. This pattern is often related to Beer’s Law for absorption of light. The second type of relationship considers light absorption in relation to leaf area index within a set of stands; Type II comparisons of light absorption across ranges of stand leaf area indexes do not usually show a logarithmic trend, and expectations for the pattern among stands should not be based on Beer’s Law. The third type of relationship focuses on total light absorption as a function of a tree’s total leaf area; Type III comparisons for sets of trees within a stand generally show linear (or even exponential) increases in light absorbance with increasing leaf area, again deviating from an (inappropriate) application of Beer’s Law. This distinction in patterns between light absorption and leaf area of trees and stands is particularly important when hypotheses are tested about the stem growth/leaf area (often termed growth efficiency, or leaf area efficiency). At the stand level (Type I), the logarithmic (or flat) relationship between light absorption and leaf area index may lead to different outcomes for hypotheses tested as a function of light absorption and those tested in relation to leaf area. At the level of individual trees (Type III), hypothesis tests based on light absorption or leaf area will provide similar answers, owing to the linear (or slightly exponential) relationship between light absorption and leaf area.},

	abstract = {The size of a tree and its crown are key drivers of its ability to intercept light. These characteristics are also constrained by biomechanical and hydraulic limitations, leading to tremendous variations in crown size and tree height between species. To date, there is no consensus on how covariation between crown characteristics (i.e. tree height, crown diameter and relative crown depth) control the spectrum of crown sizes, nor on the species characteristics (i.e. species climate niche or functional traits) that govern their variation. Using species-specific allometric relationships accounting for local competition data on individual crown characteristics of tree species across Europe and North America, we showed that the spectrum of tree crown size is mainly driven by two independent axes: one correlating tree height with relative crown depth, and another linking crown diameter to crown volume. While both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibited similar patterns of covariation for these crown characteristics, distinct ecological strategies emerged for maximum tree height. We also highlighted that shade-tolerant species were characterized by wider and deeper crowns and showed reduced sensitivity to local competition in relative crown depth, indicating enhanced competitive resilience. Finally, simulations of light interception in virtual stands performed using a ray tracing algorithm highlighted the importance of different crown characteristics in various competitive contexts. Tree height was the primary determinant of light interception in low competitive contexts, common in early successional stages, whereas relative crown depth and crown diameter played a more significant role in high-competitive contexts typical of late succession. These findings suggest that shade-tolerant species, with their deeper crowns, are better equipped to intercept light under competition and ultimately emphasize the ability of shade tolerance to improve the realism of forest dynamic models as it can be used as an indicator of crown size and its response to competition.},
