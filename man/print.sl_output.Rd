\description{
Prints a concise overview of a SamsaRaLight simulation result, including
stand size, grid geometry, model configuration, and which outputs
(trees, cells, sensors, rays, interceptions) are available.
}
\details{
This method is designed to give a quick human-readable summary of what
was simulated and what was produced, without printing large data tables.

The printed output includes:
\itemize{
\item Stand size (area, number of trees, cells, sensors)
\item Grid geometry (number of cells and resolution)
\item Radiation model parameters (latitude, time period, turbid medium, etc.)
\item Which light and interception outputs are available
}

Use \code{\link{summary.sl_output}} to obtain numerical summaries
of light, interception and energy variables, and \code{\link{plot.sl_output}}
for graphical inspection.
