#' SamsaRaLight: Forest light interception and radiation simulation
#'
#' SamsaRaLight is an R package for simulating forest stand light interception,
#' energy balance and radiation transfer using spatially explicit tree crowns,
#' sensors and grid cells.
#'
#' The package provides tools to:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Build forest stands with trees, cells and sensors
#'   \item Run ray-tracing based light simulations
#'   \item Compute tree, cell and sensor energy variables
#'   \item Summarize and visualize simulation outputs
#' }
